# Automated-Railway-station-using-openCV
Railway Station Management System using OpenCV: Smart lighting and temperature control for energy efficiency. Real-time fire detection enhances safety. Automated, intelligent, and secure.

The smart railway station project employs computer
vision using OpenCV for fan and light control, as well
as fire detection, with the following working
principles: Hardware Setup: Install cameras foroccupancy detection and sensors for fire detection.
Computer Vision Algorithms: Use OpenCV to analyze
video feeds for occupancy and identify potential fire
incidents. Control Systems: Connect OpenCV-based
systems to control fans and lights based on
occupancy, and trigger alarms for fire detection. Data
Processing: Process real-time data from cameras and
sensors to make informed decisions. Communication
and Integration: Ensure seamless communication
between components and integrate with other
railway station systems. User Interface: Develop a
monitoring dashboard for administrators to visualize
and manage the system. Safety Compliance: Adhere
to safety regulations and standards for public spaces.
